# CV-5-Layer-Security-Architecture
Modern vehicles represent a complex distributed network of connected hardware and software systems, which aim to provide full automation to the Connected Vehicles (CV). But every IT system that operates via communication networks is a subject to potential security vulnerabilities. In this project, we team of 5, identified the required security and privacy guidelines as well as design a security framework to safeguard the Connected Vehicles. We aimed to address the many challenges of security and privacy risks, which will further help to increase the level of confidence and trust in connected vehicle systems.
